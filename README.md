This is my first HTML project.
I got the project from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
I will be adding what I have learned into this README.md file to reference and review in the future.

10/20/19 - I learned about the "button" element! I used it to make the "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky" buttons.

10/30/2019 - Project complete for now. What I learned were that there is quite a bit of formatting and styling required for things that you would think are simple. Such as creating a search bar! 

My main take-away is that there are seemingly infinite resources to help with projects like this. Whenever I was feeling stuck I could always find help somewhere.

I wasn't looking to make an exact replica of the Google home-page, I was mostly looking to get an idea of how HTML and CSS work and flow with eachother as well as get some practical and hands on us from them. For the most part I feel good about how it turned out. 

I did notice that the "Sign In" button didn't show the full text and couldn't figure out why. I also had difficulty getting the text in the footer to center within the footer. 

My "aha" moment with this project was getting the "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky" buttons to center. I was assigned them separate classes and gave those classes a padding but that kept spacing them not only from the edge, but also from eachother. I ended up realizing that I needed to set them to the same class and then padding that, which gave the desired effect.
